### ONLINE TUITION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
#### In this project we have modelled an online tuition management system. In this system, students and teachers will each create an online account. Students will choose the courses they want to study. The teachers will select the course they want to teach. The system will then allocate the teachers to these courses and a schedule will be created. The schedule will mention the days and timings of the courses, and the names of the teachers
